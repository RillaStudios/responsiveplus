## üìå Features

This package provides many widgets and methods to add repsonsivness to your Flutter app.

List of features:

<h3>ü´ß Widgets:</h3>

- RowColumn widget: Adds ability to display a Row or Column widget based off current screen size.
- WrapColumn widget: Adds ability to display a Wrap or Column widget based off current screen size.
- ResponsiveChild widget: A wrap around a singlular child which will make the child responsive and react to screen size changes.
- ResponsiveChilren widget: A wrap around multiple chilred which will make all the children responsive and react to screen size changes.

<h4>üóö Rext Widget</h4>

- Rext widget: A Text widget that will automatically adjust its size based on screen size.
- Rext Group: A RextGroup can be added to any and multiple Rext widgets. When assigning a RextGroup to a Rext widget this will ensure all the Rexts in that group have the same font size.

<h5>Types of Rext Widgets</h5>

- Rext -
  This is the basic Rext widget and will return a basic Text widget as its child. This will require a String as its data.

- Rext.rich -
  This is will return a RichText widget and will require a TextSpan as its data. <b>Note:</b> This does not support a WidgetSpan, the TextSpans children must only contain other TextSpans. Consider using a Wrap widget if you'd like to include Widgets in the text.

- Rext.selectable -
  This will return a SelectableText widget and will require a String as its data. This Text can be selected by the user and copied/pasted or you can add custom methods.

## üìã Getting started

## üß™ Usage

To use this package, add ResponsivePlus as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

```dart
import 'package:responsive/responsive.dart';

/// Example App
/// This is an example app that shows some of the features of the ResponsivePlus package.
class ExampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const ExampleApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Container(
          width: 75.w, // 75% of the screen width
          height: 50.h, // 50% of the screen height
          color: Colors.green,
          child: ResponsiveChild(
            onScreenSizeChanged: (constraints) {
              /// This function will be called whenever the screen size changes (this is an optional parameter)
              print('Screen size changed to: ${constraints.maxWidth}x${constraints.maxHeight}');
            },
            child: (context, constraints) {
              /// Child will set its constraints based on the
              /// size of the parent container and can use it
              ///to calculate the size of its children, in this
              ///case it is a Rext widget.
              ///
              ///Explanation:
              ///
              ///Lets pretend the users screen size is 1000px
              ///
              ///The Container is 75% of the screen height (which would be 750px)
              ///The Rext widgets initial font size is 2% of that 750px, which would
              ///equal 15px.
              ///
              return Center(
                child: Rext(
                  'This is a Rext widget inside a Container',
                  maxLines: 1,
                  fontSize: 2.cw(constraints),
                ),
              );
